After its launch in June of 2019, it has seen tremendous growth by partnering with major commerce players in Korea such as TMON (general e-Commerce), Yanolja (hospitality and leisure), and CU (#1 convenience store with over 14000 stores across Korea). Some key metrics for the project are as follows: 1M+ users accumulated in less than a year, $400M in expected annual transactions (run-rate), integrations with 12+ major commerce players in Korea with many more to come. Chai's transaction volumes are reflected on the Terra blockchain, meaning that The transaction volumes of the Chai payment application are correlated with Terra transaction volumes.\nChai utilizes seigniorage-funded discounts to offer deals for customers who choose Chai at merchant checkout. This creates a virtuous cycle where (1) users select Chai at a merchant's checkout page (2) Chai/Terra tx volume increases which in turn increases Terra money supply (seigniorage creation) (3) seigniorage is allocated to Chai which then uses it as a budget for providing promotion discounts (4) Users are incentivized to use Chai at checkout due to seigniorage-driven promotional schemes.\nGiven the scale of current Chai transaction volumes, its potential to capture even more volume through continued business growth, and its clear value proposition for both the Terra ecosystem and users shoppping for everyday goods and services, it is our firm belief that Chai provides the highest ROI for seigniorage spent at this juncture.", "recipient":
